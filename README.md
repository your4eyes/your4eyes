Hi! I'm 4eyes. Software engineer, Frontend/Backend developer, Pentester, Singer, and Artist.

Scripting languages I know:
Bash, Javascript, Lua, PHP, and Powershell

Programming languages I know:
C, C#, C++, Java, Rust (Learning)

I specialize in scripting, game testing, and bugfixing. I accept robux, roblox cards, visa cards, or crypto. Bit lazy with deadlines, so I may be a day or so late, but if I say I will do something, I will. I have done 2 commissions and have 2 happily satisfied customers.

Current Offers (ROBLOX):
Scripting will be paid based on time and complexity. Game testing will be 1k R$ with thorough tests and a full evaluation. If you want me to fix bugs found DURING this testing, it's an extra 2-4k R$.
